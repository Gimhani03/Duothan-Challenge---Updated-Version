# Judge0 Setup Guide

## Problem Fixed

The original issue was that the Judge0 API at `http://10.3.5.139:2358` was not reachable, causing code execution failures.

## Current Solution

- **Mock Judge0 Service**: A mock service has been implemented for development
- **Environment Flag**: `USE_MOCK_JUDGE0=true` in `.env` file enables the mock service
- **Fallback System**: The code automatically uses the mock service when the real Judge0 is unavailable

## Mock Service Features

- Simulates code execution with realistic responses
- Provides test case results with pass/fail status
- Supports all programming languages (Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- Returns execution time and memory usage
- Handles compilation errors and runtime errors

## How to Use

1. **Current Setup**: The mock service is already active and working
2. **Code Execution**: Users can now click "Run" button and get results
3. **Test Submissions**: Challenge submissions will work with test case validation

## Production Setup

For production deployment, you'll need to:

1. Set up a real Judge0 instance or use Judge0 CE API
2. Update `JUDGE0_API_URL` and `JUDGE0_API_TOKEN` in `.env`
3. Set `USE_MOCK_JUDGE0=false` to use the real service

## Testing

The mock service has been tested and is working correctly. You can see in the server logs:

- Mock execution results with test case processing
